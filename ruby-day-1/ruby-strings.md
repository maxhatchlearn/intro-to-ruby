### Ruby Strings

**Quotes**

Strings are how we represent text in Ruby. We need to protect the text from the Ruby interpreter so it doesn't think our text is actually code:

        > these are some words
        NameError: undefined local variable or method 'words' for main:Object
        from (irb):6
        from /Users/maxplomer/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.3-p194/bin/irb:16:in '<main>'
